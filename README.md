# wegetit

An implementation of WeGetIt from Karl Schroeder's short story Degrees of Freedom

## deploying

The current setup is designed to use gunicorn as its server. You can run it from
bash with the command

```
$ gunicorn -w 4 -b $ADDRESS:$PORT "wegetit:main($DBFILE)"
```

You must specify a path for `$DBFILE`, as this is where the program will store
the database. Putting it in somewhere like `/tmp/wegetit/db.json` or
`/var/wegetit/db.json` is usually a good idea.

## terminology

For lack of better terms, "definitions" describes the term-definition-paraphrase portions of WeGetIt, while "conversations" describes the broad collection of definitions.

### possible terminology improvement

"conversation" might be a bit ambiguous so perhaps "topic" is better?

"term/definition" might lead people to feel ownership over a term, so it might
better to use something like "perspective" or "interpretation"?

## pages/flows - minimal version

- Main Page
  - Overview/description of WeGetIt
  - List of conversations
- Create Convo
  - Title + Description
- View Convo
  - Title + Description
  - List of definitions in this conversation --click--> view definition
- View Definition
  - Term
  - Initial definition
  - Add your own paraphrase
  - Other paraphrases + good/bad judgment

## pages/flows - fuller version?

- Main Page
  - Overview/description of WeGetIt
  - List of conversations you've created
  - List of conversations you've joined
- My Conversations Page
  - Convo ID + Description --click--> Manager for this convo

- Manage Convo
  - Overview of what the conversation is about
  - List of definitions in this conversation --click--> view definition
- View Definition
  - Term

## considerations

- ease of setup - no signup required
- privacy/anonymity
- ability to return to conversations/connect up multiple convos?
- how to have more feedback beyond just "we get it!", without it devolving into arguments?
  - idea: maybe let the definer highlight some parts of the definition and explicitly mark those as not what they mean?
