      <h1>WeGetIt</h1>

      <p>
        WeGetIt is an experimental communication platform that strives for shared understanding above all else.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than providing a means for completely unrestricted conversations, which are prone to devolving into flame wars and pointless hate, WeGetIt structures conversations around understanding one another's meanings.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>

      <p>
        Below is a list of "threads". Each is a structured conversation, with a name describing it, and a brief detailed overview of the topic under discussion in that thread. You can create a new thread by clicking the text
        <code>+&nbsp;New&nbsp;Thread</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within each thread, there are "perspectives", which present a fellow user's way of understanding a word or term of their choosing. Each perspective consists of the word or term, together with the user's personal interpretation of what it means, in
        their own words. You can add your own perspectives on whatever word you want by clicking the text
        <code>+&nbsp;New&nbsp;Perspective</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within each perspective, there are "paraphrases", which are other users rewording of the original user's personal interpretation. These paraphrases are supposed to be mere restatements of the original meaning in the perspective. A good way to write a
        paraphrase would begin with something like "I understand you as saying ...". You can add your own paraphrase on a perspective by clicking the text
        <code>+&nbsp;New&nbsp;Paraphrase</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each paraphrase can be rated by the original author of the perspective that's being paraphrased. The judgments are either "Not Quite", which indicates that the paraphrase isn't exactly what the original author meant, or "We Get It!", which means that
        the original author things that the paraphrase is a good paraphrase of their meaning. These judgments will show up next to the paraphrases once they are given by the original author.
      </p>

      <p>
        All parts of this are anonymous and unlinked. A browser cookie is used to allow you to be identified to the server as the author of particular threads, perspectives, and paraphrases, but no login or username is required, and if you clear your browser
        cookies, the server will no longer know who you are. These conversations are meant to be anonymous, and we don't want people to fight with one another offline over the particular meanings or paraphrases. Rather, we want people to understand each
        other, first and foremost.
      </p>

      <h2>Origins</h2>

      <p>
        WeGetIt is a program originally envisioned in Karl Schroeder's short story
        <em>Degrees of Freedom</em>, in the
        <em>Hieroglyph</em>
        anthology. It's intended to form an integral part of a future political system that is more just and fair. It fits in well with the general theme of Hieroglyph as a collection of science fiction stories that inspire people to work on and build a
        better tomorrow.
      </p>

      <p>
        We build WeGetIt precisely because we yearn to build a better tomorrow, and were inspired by Schroeder's story. We don't know if WeGetIt can, or will, have the same importance in the real world as it did in his story, but we believe that it's
        important to explore and experiment with these things. If no one builds the better tomorrow, then we can't expect it to arrive.
      </p>

      <h2>Copyright Info</h2>

      <p>
        We want people to build and expand on this, so we offer WeGetIt to the world as free software, licensed under AGPLv3.
